# How to run the project:

1. Install JSON Server `npm install -g json-server`
2. A "clientes.json" is already provided, so we don't need to create one in this step.
3. Open a new terminal and start JSON Server `json-server --watch db/clientes.json`
4. Run `npm install` to rebuild project dependencies.
5. Run `ng serve --open` to start the project.

Made with Angular and JSON Server
